I am a Master's student in Computer Science at DePaul University, working with Professor Tanu Malik at the [DICE Lab](https://dice.cs.depaul.edu). My research interests span across:

**Primary Research Areas:**
- Databases and Data Management
- High Performance Computing
- Systems Development

**Specific Research Focus:**
- Big Data Systems for Scientific Computing
- Data Provenance and Reproducibility
- Scientific Data Management
- Data Virtualization Techniques
- Query Optimization and Approximate Computing

Before joining DePaul, I worked as a Software Engineer for 5 years, gaining extensive experience in software development and system design. This industry experience has provided me with a strong foundation in building robust and scalable systems, which complements my current research focus on data management.

I am planning to apply for PhD programs in Computer Science this year, with a focus on advancing research in scientific data management and reproducible computing.

In my free time, I enjoy [add your hobbies/interests here].
