Hi there! I am a Master's student(2024/04-2026/04) in Computer Science at DePaul University, working with Professor Tanu Malik at the <a href="https://dice.cs.depaul.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DICE Lab.

My research focuses on <strong>Program Analysis</strong>, <strong>Data Provenance</strong>, and <strong>Web Security</strong>. Specifically, I want to solve web security issues through both static and dynamic program analysis methods.

Before DePaul, I worked as a Software Engineer at ByteDance and iFlyTek for 5 years, where I gained valuable industry experience in web development and systems.


**I am planning to apply for PhD programs in Computer Science this year, with a focus on advancing research in scientific program analysis and web security.** You can find my CV [here](link-to-your-cv) and reach me at [chuxulu.volary@gmail.com](mailto:chuxulu.volary@gmail.com).

In my free time, I enjoy runningüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
