      <p>I'm contributing to novel methods for program analysis and debugging. I've worked on the <strong>Minimum Path Recovery Set (mPRS)</strong> algorithm that significantly reduces instrumentation overhead while maintaining full execution path recovery. </p>
      <p>I'm also a co-author on <strong>"Accurate Differential Analysis using Record and Selective Replay"</strong> (SSDBM 2025), where we developed techniques to improve divergence-localization in distributed systems by 30%. </p>
